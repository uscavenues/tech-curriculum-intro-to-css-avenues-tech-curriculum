## Step 1 — Accept and open your repo
- Accept the GitHub Classroom invitation (your private repo will be created).  
- Open your repo:
  - **VS Code**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <repo-name>
    code .
    ```

## Step 2 — Practice terminal basics
Open your Terminal (Mac: ⌘+Space → “Terminal”; Windows: Win+X → Terminal).  
Try:
```bash
pwd      # print working directory
ls       # list files
cd ..    # go up a folder
